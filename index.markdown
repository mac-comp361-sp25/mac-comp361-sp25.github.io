Welcome to the COMP361 (Theory of Computation) Course Page. For course policies, please check the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/137yvRo-R4IydA_UyBzGdDzL10Gp9GHXopfIHhUzfSII/edit?usp=sharing). 


### Resources

#### Textbook
We will be using Sipser's [*Introduction to the Theory of Computation*](https://macalester.on.worldcat.org/search/detail/761858892?queryString=introduction%20to%20the%20theory%20of%20computation), 3rd edition. 

Be aware of [known typos](https://math.mit.edu/~sipser/itoc-errs3.1.html) in the book as you read.

#### Office Hours
MON 4:30-6pm \\
THU 4:30-5:30pm \\
FRI 4:30-5:30pm \\
OLRI 229

If you cannot make these times, please feel free to set up an appointment via email. 

### Schedule
The schedule below will be updated to keep track of all released course materials. Keep in mind that I may shift planned topics to adjust pace as necessary.

### Homeworks
All homework assignments will be posted here, but are to be submitted on the Moodle Course page. 

Note that while you are expected to complete *all* homework problems, some assignments may only have a subset of problems that will be graded for accuracy. These problems will be indicated in the instructions, if in a PDF, or by bolding if the problems are listed here. 

#### Homework 0

Sipser Problems: 0.4 ($AxB$), 0.5 (size of the power set of $A$), 0.11 ($C(n) = \sum^n i^3$), **0.12** (All horses are the same color), **0.13** (Every graph w/ 2+ nodes has 2 nodes with equal degree), 0.14 (Ramsey's Thm.)

Bolded questions will be graded for correctness and clarity. I recommend struggling with 0.14 for at least a day or two before consulting the provided solution. 

**Out:** Jan 23rd.
**Due:** 11:59pm, Jan 31st. 
**Template:** [LaTeX]({{site.url}}/hws/HW0_Template.tex)

**NOTES:** This assignment will hopefully mostly *review* of material from (primarily) Discrete Mathematics, as well as some moderate extensions of things you should already know to fit the context of this course. 
**Be aware that things you do already know might look a bit unfamiliar at first!** This is an opportunity to familiarize yourself with my style of presentation without having to worry about being unfamiliar with the material!

**WARNING**: Apparently problem numbers are shuffled between editions. A short description has been added so you solve the right problems.

#### Homework 1

**Out:** Feb 3rd.
**Due:** 11:59pm, Feb 9th. \\
[**Instructions**]({{site.url}}/hws/HW1.pdf)
**Template**: [LaTeX]({{site.url}}/hws/HW1.tex)

**NOTES:** Problem 2 is a good example of the kind of presentation/support I'd provide for a problem that requires you to prove a DFA accepts a particular language. 2b is a good example of a place where using induction to do so may be helpful. 

#### Homework 2

**OUT:** Feb 10th.
**DUE:** 11:59pm, Feb 17th. \\
[**Instructions**]({{site.url}}/hws/HW2.pdf)
**Template**: [LaTeX]({{site.url}}/hws/HW2.tex)

**Notes:** Be aware that while 2b is not graded, a reasonable solution to 2b is necessary to get full points on 2c, so it is ungraded but effectively mandatory.

#### Homework 3

**OUT:** Feb 19th
**DUE:** 11:59pm Feb 26th \\
[**Instructions**]({{site.url}}/hws/HW3.pdf)
**Template**: [LaTeX]({{site.url}}/hws/HW3.tex)
