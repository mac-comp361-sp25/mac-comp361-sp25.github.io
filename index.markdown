Welcome to the COMP361 (Theory of Computation) Course Page. For course policies, please check the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/137yvRo-R4IydA_UyBzGdDzL10Gp9GHXopfIHhUzfSII/edit?usp=sharing). 


### Resources

#### Textbook
We will be using Sipser's [*Introduction to the Theory of Computation*](https://macalester.on.worldcat.org/search/detail/761858892?queryString=introduction%20to%20the%20theory%20of%20computation), 3rd edition. 

Be aware of [known typos](https://math.mit.edu/~sipser/itoc-errs3.1.html) in the book as you read.

#### Office Hours
**TBD**: My office hours will be determined from the responses on the beginning of course survey!

### Schedule
The schedule below will be updated to keep track of all released course materials. Keep in mind that I may shift planned topics to adjust pace as necessary.

### Homeworks
All homework assignments will be posted here, but are to be submitted on the Moodle Course page. 

Note that while you are expected to complete *all* homework problems, some assignments may only have a subset of problems that will be graded for accuracy. These problems will be indicated in the instructions, if in a PDF, or by bolding if the problems are listed here. 

#### Homework 0

Sipser Problems: 0.4, 0.5, 0.11, **0.12**, **0.13**, 0.14

Bolded questions will be graded for correctness and clarity. I recommend struggling with 0.14 for at least a day or two before consulting the provided solution. 

**Out:** Jan 23rd.
**Due:** 5pm, Jan 31st. 

**NOTEs:** This assignment will hopefully mostly *review* of material from (primarily) Discrete Mathematics, as well as some moderate extensions of things you should already know to fit the context of this course. 
**Be aware that things you do already know might look a bit unfamiliar at first!** This is an opportunity to familiarize yourself with my style of presentation without having to worry about being unfamiliar with the material!
